|Brent Alexander|While we are on lock-down we need to get creative with our facilities, so please excuse the screaming toddlers. Today we chatted to Brent Alexander a Co-Founder of 3DPSA which is a movement that has managed to mobilize hundreds of 3D printers across the country to print personal protective gear for our front-line workers. We also chat to Christy Haefele the Founder of Beating Heart, a charity organisation in the Western Cape that is fulfilling a crucial role in this movement.
